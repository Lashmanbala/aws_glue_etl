# AWS Glue ETL

## Overview
AWS Glue ETL is a serverless data integration service that simplifies the creation, operation, and scaling of data processing pipelines. 
This repository includes Glue scripts, configurations, and workflows to process and transform data for analytics.

## Architecture
The solution leverages AWS Glue for data extraction, transformation, and loading with additional AWS services:
- **S3** for data storage
- **AWS Glue Data Catalog** for metadata management
- **Amazon Redshift** or **Amazon RDS** for data warehousing
- **IAM** for security and access management

## Setup
To set up and deploy this solution, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- AWS account
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- Access to the AWS Glue service

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Lashmanbala/aws_glue_etl.git
    ```
2. Configure your AWS environment and IAM roles.

3. Upload any necessary datasets to the specified S3 bucket.

4. Add Glue job scripts to the AWS Glue Console or initiate them with the Glue CLI.

## ETL Jobs
This repository includes the following ETL jobs:
1. **Data Extraction Job**: Reads data from a specified source (e.g., S3).
2. **Data Transformation Job**: Processes and transforms the extracted data.
3. **Data Load Job**: Writes the transformed data to a destination (e.g., Redshift or RDS).

Each job uses PySpark scripts, optimized for processing large datasets.

## Usage
To execute the ETL jobs:
1. Navigate to the AWS Glue Console.
2. Select the desired job and start it, or use the CLI:
    ```bash
    aws glue start-job-run --job-name <job_name>
    ```

3. Monitor the job progress in the Glue Console.

### Scheduling
You can schedule jobs by setting up triggers in AWS Glue or using AWS CloudWatch Events for automation.

## Troubleshooting
If a job fails, check the following:
- **Job Logs**: Available in AWS CloudWatch.
- **Data Catalog**: Ensure tables and metadata are correctly defined.
- **IAM Permissions**: Confirm that the Glue service has access to necessary resources.
